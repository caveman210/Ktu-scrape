# Ktu-scrape

`A (failed) Try of webscraping KTU syllabus from their website`

A webcrawler and webscraper focussed on pulling PDFs from KTU website. 

**NGL, I'm kinda surprised by the ktu.edu.in website. Half the efforts spent on that website is all that's needed to fix the 504 gateway error on their servers lol.**

Until now:

    1. We have a selenium script ready to download a non-existent pdf link.
    2. We have a script which can successfully open up their page and close by itself (Wow, great progress.)
    ~~3. And we have a script which rage-quits after a 15-second timer, cause it can't find anything. (Just another failure like daddy)~~
    3. The website rage-quits just cause its braincells close off after clicking the first link.
