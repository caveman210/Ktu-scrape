# Ktu-scrape

`A (failed) Try of webscraping KTU syllabus from their website`

Alright, so as of right now, KTU website seems to be not giving out the body of their website, as part of their (probably) anti-bot measures.

**Which means KTU has, surprisingly, put some effort into making a website? (And yet they can't fix their own student portal, sheesh)**
SO, now it's upto us to work that out.

Until now:
    1. We have a selenium script ready to download a non-existent pdf link.
    2. We have a script which can successfully open up their page and close by itself (Wow, great progress.)
    3. And we have a script which starts crying after a 15-second timer cause it can't find anything.
